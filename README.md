# CSGOInv App Project
  Desktop App for viewing and storing Steam Counter-Strike: Global Offensive inventory prices.
  
  Inventory items and their prices are obtained through <a href="https://csgobackpack.net/" target="_blank">csgobackpack.net</a>.
  
  The page's html is obtained using the <strong>Requests</strong> module.
  
  Then a dataframe of the items and prices table is generated using the <strong>Pandas</strong> module.
